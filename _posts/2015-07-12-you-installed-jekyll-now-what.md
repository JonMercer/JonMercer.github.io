1. Open up your `_config.yml` and change the title and description.
2. If you have a gmail address, consider adding a <email>+blog@gmail.com. This should hopefully help you filter out some spam (at least the less sophisticated ones).
3. You should also change your `about` page.

I hope to keep logging the changes I've done so that I can compile everything into a tutorial once I know more about Jekyll.
