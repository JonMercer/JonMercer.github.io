I was tasked with putting a video in a USB to be played on a continuous loop in a cafe television. The video I had was in .mov format. It was so difficult to find a free converter than didn't have any limitatons. The best converter I found was "VideoMonkey". After it was converted, I had to paste the video in an NTFS drive. There was a command line tutorial I used in the past, but it didn't work in OSX 10.10.2 aka Yosemite. Luckily, there was a video on how to accomplish this using a myriad of applications. The video's called "Enable NTFS Write support on Mac OS X Yosemite for FREE". Here's the link.
